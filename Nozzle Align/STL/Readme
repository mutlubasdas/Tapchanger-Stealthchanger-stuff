It's a hybrid of fiferboy's and viesturz's models along with my own tweaks here and there.
Kinda like a sexbolt but I guess. But it does XYZ calibration with Nozzle Align script.

You'll need a M5 bolt and T-nut, D2F switch, some wires, 2.50mm pitch JST XH connector, 12mm ball bearing ball and some lube.

I recommend printing them as shown in the slicer orientation screenshot.
